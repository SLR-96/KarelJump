# KarelJump
The final project for Stanford's CS106A online course, "Code In Place"

This is a game, written from scratch in Python based on Doodle Jump. In this game, Karel (the robot character from Stanford's CS106A) keeps jumping up as long as it can land on a surface, which is provided by the paddles. By jumping on the paddles, Karel moves up and increases its score. The main challenge of the game is that as Karel moves up, the width of the paddels decreases, to the point where the rectangular paddles turn into square blocks. Once the player misses a paddle and falls down, the game is over.

A demonstration of the gameplay is available in the link below:
